How does forecast accuracy degrade as a function of prediction horizon, and what does this suggest about LSTM’s ability to model longer term financial trends?\nQ3. How well can we classify each trading day in 2024 into low, medium, or high volatility regimes based on recent price action and market indicators?\nQ4. How can hierarchical clustering organize S&P 500 stocks into a taxonomy based on multi-factor risk or return exposures?"
